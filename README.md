#### Known Issues:    
* The user avatar will be blank, Check [#83](https://github.com/mrpond/BlockTheSpot/issues/83) for more info.   
* The new UI will have black banner without ads. See [#150](https://github.com/mrpond/BlockTheSpot/issues/150)

### Additional Notes:  
* BlockTheSpot might only works as expected with the last tested version. Please check it before opening an issue.  
* "chrome_elf.dll" gets replaced by the Spotify installer each time it updates, hence why you'll probably need to apply the patch again when it happens
* [Spicetify](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli) users will need to reapply BlockTheSpot after applying a Spicetify patches.
